He was a writer. He thought he wrote about the future but 
it really was the past. In his novel, a mysterious train 
left for 2046 every once in a while. Everyone who went 
there had the same intention.....to recapture their lost

Nobody knew for sure if it was true, because nobody who 
went there had ever come back- except for one. He was 
there. He chose to leave. He wanted to change.
